# Popeye

## A simple app (like strawpoll.com) to learn how to use Docker containers

## Usage

Check that Docker is installed on your computer and started.
``` zsh
docker-compose up
```
Then go to [localhost:5001](localhose:5001) and [localhost:8080](localhost:8080).

With this project I learned how to use Docker images and Docker compose.
